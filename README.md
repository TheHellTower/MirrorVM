## ðŸ“œ What it does ?

It's "virtualizing" code into instructions which only [MirrorVM](https://github.com/TheHellTower/MirrorVM) can understand so no begginer in code that decompile your program can understand what is happening(`fool moment`) !
This will be a `1:1` VM it mean each opcode will be "reflected"(`unlike with Custom OPCodes which make it harder to understand and devirtualize`, ex: [Conv_R4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.conv_r4) & [Conv_R8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.emit.opcodes.conv_r8) being handled by a single `CustomConv` OPCode built especally for the VM)
